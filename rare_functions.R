# functions for analysis of the rare biosphere, including:
# 1. TRT/PRT/CRT (Shade et al. 2014) calculations
# 2. Identification of the rare biosphere at different thresholds

# Calculate of permenantly rare taxa (PRT)

# Calculate transiently rare taxa (TRT)

# Calculate conditionally rare taxa (CRT; Shade et al. 2014)
