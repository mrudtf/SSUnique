Thank you for showing interest in SSUnique. Some sections of the program are currently being rewritten and will be released shortly after I return from ISME. I will be announce the release of SSUnique here and through Twitter (@mdjlynch).

The poster presented at ISME, which discusses both SSUnique and AXIOME, is available from: https://www.dropbox.com/s/lq6zsncikd0yr9n/ISME14_mdjlynch.pdf

Our publication using the approach that developed into SSUnique is available from ISME J (doi:10.1038/ismej.2012.50) - open access
